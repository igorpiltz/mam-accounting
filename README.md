# mam-accounting
Accounting package running in a JSP container.
This is an accounting package that I wrote for a small cleaning firm. 
For me it was mostly to test Java technologies like JSP, JPA and Hibernate. 
It has basic accounting, can produce the usual accounting reports and some basic facilities for making data entry easier. 
It has a very crude "automatic" import from online banking feature which worked only intermittently.

It did care of of the accounting for that firm for a couple of years.
